# Evolution and AI
This is my genetic algorithm that subjects 1000 smart dots to an obstacle course and forces them to learn how to navigate towards the goal without hitting any obstacles. 

Each dot has a brain that 'learns' how to move around, the more succesful dots will have offspring that inherit the parents genome, whilst being subjected to mutations. Therefore using evolution to reach the goal.

### Notes
- Green dot is the best dot of last generation
- Red dot is the goal
